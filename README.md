This file has been modified.
I was forced to modify it in Github :(
Oh to be a college student who practices redundancy.

I learned how to merge files and resolve the conflicts between them. I got familiar with the push and pull commands and some of the syntax of markdown. I learned how to use the functionality in VScode for committing - which I did not know before. I know how to push and pull from the terminal and from the IDE now and I also know how to commit from terminal, IDE and Github which is good because I was confused before. And now this is all on line 6 so we will see how that goes. I also learned how to save all using CTRL K and then S. I learned how to identify myself and set my identity for git too. I forked someone's code and, Finally, I was able to clone a repository that I made so that was pretty cool.
Always Add, Commit, Push until your fingers fall off.

## Development and Production environments
-my development environment is my computer and my production environment is AWS
-Never develop in the production environment
-Deployment of app should be done via a CI (continuous integration) process- this checkouts the application code, links it, builds it, tests it, stages it, tests it more, and finally pushes the application to the production environment and notifies.
-we are gonna use a simple console shell script for our CI process.
-to deploy run `./deployService.sh -k ~/prod.pem -h yourdomain.click -s simon` or something akin to that.
k provides the credential file to access production environment, h is domain name of prod environment, s is the name of the app you are deploying (simon or startup).

## The internet
IP addresses are the the addresses of servers. IP addresses are how computers find each other. We don't usually use the string of numbers and so we just use like google.com. Computers we use are clients bc they are not directly connected to the internet. They use an ISP (internet service provider). When info is transfered on the internet it's transferred in packages that are reassembled at arrival. IP addresses also apply to things indirectly connected to the internet. Anywhere two or more parts of the internet intersect, there is a router. Routers direct our packets of info around. When you send something, the info is wrapped in layers of all the IP addresses it passes through (routers have IP addresses). Info can go back to where it came from by looking at the IPs it's wrapped in and retracing its steps.
### TCP/IP layers
1. Application- user functionality, web (http), mail, files, remote shell, chat. 
2. Transport (TCP)- breaks application layer into small chunks and sends the data.
3. Internet (IP)- makes the connections, devices need IP addresses to talk ex. 128.187.16.184 (BYU), we usually use domain names as a stand in for IP addresses. Doing a lookup in the DNS (Domain name system) can convert domains names to ip addresses. Use `dig byu.edu` to find the IP address for byu on your terminal. To connect a device first asks for a connection route which consists of hops around the network until a path is discovered and connection established. Then the Transport and application layers start exchanging data. To elucidate the path, use the `traceroute byu.edu` to see how your computer connects. If you run `traceroute` again you might get a different path since it's dynamic.
4. Link- physical connections and hardware

## Web Servers
- Monolithic web servers- http software on a hardware server, olden days,  these are outdated now we have dynamic functionality with allows us to generate HTML on demand in reponse to users

- Web and application service can be combined ig
- Web service gateways- they run on the common http port 443. Since multiple web services can be run on the same computing device, different ports are used so a unique connection can be made to each. The gateway or reverse proxy basically listens on 443 and directs the user to the proper port.

- Microservice- web service that provides a single functional purpose. Since functionality is partitioned it can be managed independently from other stuff in a large system. They are also good at handling large differences in user volume by just running more instances of the service.

- I guess we're serverless now?? This section really made no sense.

## Domain Names
- Sometimes there are multiple IP addresses associated with one domain name. This is in case one address fails to make a valid connection. Domain name- text string listed in a database called domain name registry
- root domain with subdomain prefixes. TLD (top level domain)- is things like com, edu, or gov
so the root domain is like byu.edu, google.com, alabama.gov, etc. ICANN controls the list of TLDs.
- you can have any number of subdomains off the root domain ex. highways.utah.fed.gov has three subdomains.
- use `whois byu.edu` to get info about a domain name off the DNR.

## DNS
- once the domain is in the registry it is listed with a domain name system (DNS) server. You also need to lease the IP address. Every DNS on earth references a few special DNS servers that are the authority in charge of associating domain names with IP addresses. 
- we mainly want to look at the address (A) and the canonical name (CNAME) records.
- A- maps from domain name to IP address
- CNAME- maps one dmain name to another domain name (this acts like a domain name alias). *CNAME could do things like map byu.com to the same IP as byu.edu so that either will get you to the website
- enter domain name into browser, browser checks to see if it has the name already in its cache of names, if not it contacts a DNA server and gets IP address. If the DNS server doesn't have the domain name it requests the name from an `authoritative name server` DNS. If that doesn't know you get a unknown domain name error. If the name is found, your browser makes an Http connection to the associated IP address. 
- TTL (time to live)- different caching layers will honor the TTL and clear cache after requested period has passed.
- you can pay to lease an unused domain name.
