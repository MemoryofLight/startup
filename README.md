I was forced to modify it in Github :(
Oh to be a college student who practices redundancy.

I learned how to merge files and resolve the conflicts between them. I got familiar with the push and pull commands and some of the syntax of markdown. I learned how to use the functionality in VScode for committing - which I did not know before. I know how to push and pull from the terminal and from the IDE now and I also know how to commit from terminal, IDE and Github which is good because I was confused before. And now this is all on line 6 so we will see how that goes. I also learned how to save all using CTRL K and then S. I learned how to identify myself and set my identity for git too. I forked someone's code and, Finally, I was able to clone a repository that I made so that was pretty cool.
Always Add, Commit, Push until your fingers fall off.
